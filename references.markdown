## Addendum

The unreliability of uniqueness mentioned in "Future Considerations" has been identified as a faulty implementation of the Bi-Value Cell Forcing Chain. All puzzles generated using our implementation of our algorithm are now unique. The Hard and Expert puzzles on the poster do have this non-unique flaw.

We tweaked our difficulty ranges for the categories as follows: Easy is 1 to 2.5, Medium is 2.5 to 4, Hard is 4 to 7, and Expert is 7 to 10.
